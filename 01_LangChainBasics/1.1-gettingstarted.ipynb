      "content='**Agentic AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that possess a degree of agency, meaning they can autonomously make decisions, take actions, and pursue goals without constant human oversight. These systems are designed to operate independently within specified parameters, adapt to changing environments, and achieve predefined objectives through their own initiative. The concept of agentic AI encompasses various dimensions, including autonomy, decision-making capabilities, learning adaptability, and the ability to interact with and respond to their environment.\\n\\n### Key Characteristics of Agentic AI\\n\\n1. **Autonomy:** Agentic AI systems can function with minimal human intervention. They can initiate actions, make decisions, and manage tasks on their own based on their programming and learned experiences.\\n\\n2. **Goal-Oriented Behavior:** These AI agents are designed to achieve specific objectives. They can set priorities, plan actions, and adjust their strategies to fulfill their goals effectively.\\n\\n3. **Adaptability and Learning:** Agentic AI often employs machine learning techniques, enabling them to learn from data, experiences, and interactions. This adaptability allows them to improve performance over time and respond to new or unforeseen situations.\\n\\n4. **Perception and Interaction:** Such AI systems can perceive their environment through sensors or data inputs and interact with it using actuators or output interfaces. This capability allows them to navigate physical spaces, manage information, and communicate with users or other systems.\\n\\n5. **Decision-Making:** Agentic AI involves sophisticated decision-making processes. These systems evaluate options, predict outcomes, and choose actions that best align with their goals and the context of their environment.\\n\\n### Examples of Agentic AI\\n\\n- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Self-driving cars navigate roads, make split-second decisions, and adjust to traffic conditions without human drivers.\\n  \\n- **Personal Assistants:** Advanced AI assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant can perform tasks, manage schedules, and provide information based on user interactions and preferences.\\n  \\n- **Robotics:** Industrial robots in manufacturing plants can operate independently to assemble products, adapt to changes in production lines, and perform complex tasks.\\n  \\n- **Drones:** Unmanned aerial vehicles can conduct surveillance, deliver packages, or perform agricultural monitoring autonomously.\\n\\n### Applications of Agentic AI\\n\\n- **Healthcare:** Autonomous systems can assist in diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and managing patient care with minimal human input.\\n  \\n- **Finance:** AI agents can manage investment portfolios, detect fraudulent activities, and optimize trading strategies independently.\\n  \\n- **Customer Service:** Chatbots and virtual agents can handle customer inquiries, process orders, and provide support without continuous human supervision.\\n  \\n- **Smart Homes:** Integrated AI systems can manage lighting, security, climate control, and appliances based on user behavior and preferences.\\n\\n### Ethical and Practical Considerations\\n\\nWhile agentic AI offers numerous advantages in efficiency, scalability, and the ability to handle complex tasks, it also raises important ethical and practical concerns:\\n\\n- **Accountability:** Determining responsibility for actions taken by autonomous AI systems can be challenging, especially in critical applications like healthcare or transportation.\\n  \\n- **Bias and Fairness:** AI agents learn from data, which may contain biases. Ensuring fairness and preventing discriminatory outcomes is essential.\\n  \\n- **Security:** Autonomous systems can be vulnerable to hacking, manipulation, or unintended behaviors, necessitating robust security measures.\\n  \\n- **Human-AI Interaction:** Balancing autonomy with human oversight is crucial to ensure that AI systems complement rather than replace human decision-making where necessary.\\n\\n### Future Directions\\n\\nThe development of agentic AI is an ongoing area of research, focusing on enhancing autonomy, improving decision-making algorithms, and ensuring ethical and safe deployment. Advances in areas like reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and human-AI collaboration are likely to further empower agentic AI systems, making them integral to various aspects of daily life and industry.\\n\\nIn summary, **agentic AI** represents a significant step towards creating intelligent systems that can operate independently, make informed decisions, and effectively achieve their objectives, offering transformative potential across multiple sectors while also necessitating careful consideration of ethical and practical implications.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1081, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 1094, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 256, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'o1-mini-2024-09-12', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5c373483f1', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-d5115c75-e37b-4ee4-9ea7-281d2e009b14-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 1081, 'total_tokens': 1094, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 256}}\n"

PolicyTutorialsBuild a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templatesOn this pageBuild a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templates\\nIn this quickstart we\\'ll show you how to build a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it\\'s just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!\\nAfter reading this tutorial, you\\'ll have a high level overview of:\\n\\n\\nUsing language models\\n\\n\\nUsing prompt templates\\n\\n\\nDebugging and tracing your application using LangSmith\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s dive in!\\nSetup\\u200b\\nJupyter Notebook\\u200b\\nThis and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebooks. Going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them. See here for instructions on how to install.\\nInstallation\\u200b\\nTo install LangChain run:\\n\\nPipCondapip install langchainconda install langchain -c conda-forge\\nFor more details, see our Installation guide.\\nLangSmith\\u200b\\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\\nAs these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\\nThe best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\nAfter you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"\\nOr, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\\nimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\\nUsing Language Models\\u200b\\nFirst up, let\\'s learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain supports many different language models that you can use interchangeably. For details on getting started with a specific model, refer to supported integrations.\\n\\nSelect chat model:Groq▾GroqOpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogle VertexAWSCohereNVIDIAFireworks AIMistral AITogether AIIBM watsonxDatabricksxAIpip install -qU \"langchain[groq]\"import getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"GROQ_API_KEY\"):  os.environ[\"GROQ_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for Groq: \")from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_modelmodel = init_chat_model(\"llama3-8b-8192\", model_provider=\"groq\")\\nLet\\'s first use the model directly. ChatModels are instances of LangChain Runnables, which means they expose a standard interface for interacting with them. To simply call the model, we can pass in a list of messages to the .invoke method.\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessagemessages = [    SystemMessage(\"Translate the following from English into Italian\"),    HumanMessage(\"hi!\"),]model.invoke(messages)API Reference:HumanMessage | SystemMessage\\nAIMessage(content=\\'Ciao!\\', additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 3, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 20, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_0705bf87c0\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, id=\\'run-32654a56-627c-40e1-a141-ad9350bbfd3e-0\\', usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 20, \\'output_tokens\\': 3, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}})\\ntipIf we\\'ve enabled LangSmith, we can see that this run is logged to LangSmith, and can see the LangSmith trace. The LangSmith trace reports token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\\nNote that ChatModels receive message objects as input and generate message objects as output. In addition to text content, message objects convey conversational roles and hold important data, such as tool calls and token usage counts.\\nLangChain also supports chat model inputs via strings or OpenAI format. The following are equivalent:\\nmodel.invoke(\"Hello\")model.invoke([{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}])model.invoke([HumanMessage(\"Hello\")])\\nStreaming\\u200b\\nBecause chat models are Runnables, they expose a standard interface that includes async and streaming modes of invocation. This allows us to stream individual tokens from a chat model:\\nfor token in model.stream(messages):    print(token.content, end=\"|\")\\n|C|iao|!||\\nYou can find more details on streaming chat model outputs in this guide.\\nPrompt Templates\\u200b\\nRight now we are passing a list of messages directly into the language model. Where does this list of messages come from? Usually, it is constructed from a combination of user input and application logic. This application logic usually takes the raw user input and transforms it into a list of messages ready to pass to the language model. Common transformations include adding a system message or formatting a template with the user input.\\nPrompt templates are a concept in LangChain designed to assist with this transformation. They take in raw user input and return data (a prompt) that is ready to pass into a language model.\\nLet\\'s create a prompt template here. It will take in two user variables:\\n\\nlanguage: The language to translate text into\\ntext: The text to translate\\n\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatesystem_template = \"Translate the following from English into {language}\"prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [(\"system\", system_template), (\"user\", \"{text}\")])API Reference:ChatPromptTemplate\\nNote that ChatPromptTemplate supports multiple message roles in a single template. We format the language parameter into the system message, and the user text into a user message.\\nThe input to this prompt template is a dictionary. We can play around with this prompt template by itself to see what it does by itself\\nprompt = prompt_template.invoke({\"language\": \"Italian\", \"text\": \"hi!\"})prompt\\nChatPromptValue(messages=[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})])\\nWe can see that it returns a ChatPromptValue that consists of two messages. If we want to access the messages directly we do:\\nprompt.to_messages()\\n[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\\nFinally, we can invoke the chat model on the formatted prompt:\\nresponse = model.invoke(prompt)print(response.content)\\nCiao!\\ntipMessage content can contain both text and content blocks with additional structure. See this guide for more information.\\nIf we take a look at the LangSmith trace, we can see exactly what prompt the chat model receives, along with token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\\nConclusion\\u200b\\nThat\\'s it! In this tutorial you\\'ve learned how to create your first simple LLM application. You\\'ve learned how to work with language models, how to create a prompt template, and how to get great observability into applications you create with LangSmith.\\nThis just scratches the surface of what you will want to learn to become a proficient AI Engineer. Luckily - we\\'ve got a lot of other resources!\\nFor further reading on the core concepts of LangChain, we\\'ve got detailed Conceptual Guides.\\nIf you have more specific questions on these concepts, check out the following sections of the how-to guides:\\n\\nChat models\\nPrompt templates\\n\\nAnd the LangSmith docs:\\n\\nLangSmith\\nEdit this pageWas this page helpful?PreviousTutorialsNextBuild a ChatbotSetupJupyter NotebookInstallationLangSmithUsing Language ModelsStreamingPrompt TemplatesConclusionCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')]"
